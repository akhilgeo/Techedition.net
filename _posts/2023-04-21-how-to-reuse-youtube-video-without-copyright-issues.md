YouTube is one of the largest video-sharing platforms on the internet, with over 2 billion monthly active users. One of the features that makes YouTube unique is the ability for creators to share their videos with the world, and Creative Commons is a license that allows creators to do just that.

**What is Creative Commons?**

Creative Commons is a licensing system that allows creators to share their work with others while still retaining certain rights. The Creative Commons licenses provide a simple, standardized way for creators to give permission for others to use, remix, and distribute their work.

There are six types of Creative Commons licenses, each with different conditions for use. These licenses include:

1. Attribution (CC BY): This license allows others to use, distribute, and remix the work, as long as they give appropriate credit to the original creator.

2. Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA): This license allows others to use, distribute, and remix the work, as long as they give appropriate credit to the original creator and any derivative works are licensed under the same terms.

3. Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND): This license allows others to use and distribute the work, but not to remix it.

4. Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC): This license allows others to use, distribute, and remix the work for non-commercial purposes, as long as they give appropriate credit to the original creator.

5. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA): This license allows others to use, distribute, and remix the work for non-commercial purposes, as long as they give appropriate credit to the original creator and any derivative works are licensed under the same terms.

6. Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND): This license allows others to use and distribute the work for non-commercial purposes, but not to remix it.
