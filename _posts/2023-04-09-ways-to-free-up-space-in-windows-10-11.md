**2. Choose the drive to clean up**

The Disk Cleanup tool will ask you which drive you want to clean up. Select the one that you want to free up space on and click OK.

**3. Select the files to delete**

After scanning the drive, Disk Cleanup will show you a list of files that you can delete to free up space. You can choose to delete temporary files, system files, and other items that you no longer need. Select the files you want to delete and click OK.

If you have files that you don't need to access frequently, you can move them to an external hard drive or USB drive to free up space on your computer. This is especially useful for large files such as videos or photos.
