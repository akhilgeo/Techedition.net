In a recent blog post, Google announced that early access to their new AI tool, Bard, would be available starting March 21. If you are interested in gaining access to Bard as a member of the general public, you will need to sign up for the waiting list, which is only available in certain regions.

**What is Google Bard?**

Bard is a large language model built on Google's LaMDA technology. It has the ability to generate human-like responses to various tasks, including question-answering, idea generation, and text summarization. It operates similar to other AI chatbots like OpenAI's Chat GPT and Microsoft's Bing search engine, but it can draw on real-time information from the internet to produce up-to-date responses.

**How to get early access to Google Bard?**

To sign up for the waitlist, simply visit the [Google Bard website](https://bard.google.com/) and select "Join waitlist". 

You will need to sign in to your Google account, and then choose whether you want to receive email updates.

Once you are granted access, Bard will be available as an add-on feature to Google's search engine. 

When you submit a query, you will see two sets of results - Google's usual search results, and a response from Bard.

While Bard is available to the public through the waiting list, it is important to note that it is still in its early stages and there have been some reported mistakes in its responses. Nonetheless, it is an exciting prospect for Google users and is sure to change the way we access information on the internet.
